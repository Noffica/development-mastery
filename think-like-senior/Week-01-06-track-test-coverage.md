## Start thinking like a senior

### Track test coverage

#### What is a reasonable percentage coverage to maintain?
As a number, this is subjective and context-sensitive. It can be meaningful once the test strategy, approach, framework etc. are decided, and the role of this number as a metric of (code) quality.

#### Does 100% coverage mean you project is 100% tested? Why?
No. "100% coverage" may simply mean 100% of _lines of code_ are exercised by the tests, **not** 100% of concerns of application/business logic, performance, error-handling or stability.

#### What impact do you think this would have on team culture?
This can instill greater discipline and quality but at the cost of time and continuous conscious effort to maintain such a culture.

Care also has to be taken about quality of tests, lest this becomes bureaucratic overhead, as well where this number fits into the overall strategy of testing. A dogmatic pursuit of a target number without a cohesive plan can become an exercise of diminishing and demotivational results.
